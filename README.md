# password-manager
This is a final version of password manager I created and is user friendly. 
The application was built in python 3.9 and I used TKinter for User Interface (UI). I added the lock log by using Canvas. 

The application has 3 entries
1) Website : user should enter a website here
2) Email/Uername : here user should enter email or user name 
3) Password: user should enter manualy a password of his choice or he can generate automatically a password by clicking on the Generate button
There a spinbox (Password length) user can select the length of passwrod he would like to genenerate and the minimun is 8 chararecters and the maximumn is 32 characters

The app contains 4 buttons
1) Search : This button will search for website in the database if the website exists it will display all infromation ,Wesite , Password and email, if the website doesnt exits there will be a warning box with information
2) Save : This button will save the entered data by user to the database and if the web site exist in the database it will be overwrite with new data and if any of the field wil be empty there will be a pup message. 
3) Generate Password: This button will generate a random password and will take into considaration the password length.
4) Copy Password: This will copy the password to cipboard and user can past it to any field. 

I added comment in the application so it easy to understand and follow the process.
